# Rust Exercises

These programming exercises are based on the problems posed in the book "[Exercises For Programmers](https://pragprog.com/book/bhwb/exercises-for-programmers)" by Brian P. Hogan.

They are just meant as fun practice problems for learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org). Any similarities to _actual_ software is purely coincidental.
